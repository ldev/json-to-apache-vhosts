# JSON to Apache2 vhost
The idea came as I were about to reconfigure Apache2 for LetsEncypt, and needed a simpler way to generate those hundred of lines. Also, inconsistency in the structure irritated me. POW, project born.

Uses file structure of SSL sertificates generated by certbot (letsencrypt) on Debian 8.

PHP choosen because... development time is of essense, as right now my domains are running with invalid SSL certificates :-D

Plans: Not much specific. Perhaps Python and Jinja2?

# Usage
 * Download this little beauty of a script
 * Do a `chmod 777 generated-vhost-configs`. This is not necessary if your user have write previlegies to the directory
 * copy `data.json.sample` to `data.json` and edit to your liking
 * Run it with `php -f parser.php` and enjoy
 
# Liceense
Do whatever you want with this. It is to be concidered public domain.
